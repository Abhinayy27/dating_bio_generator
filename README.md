#  DinnerTonight - AI Dating Bio Generator

Ever stared at a blank dating bio section, wondering how to sum up your dazzling personality in a sentence or two? Same. So I built **DinnerTonight** — a web app that helps you craft the *perfect* dating profile bio using a sprinkle of  AI magic  and some good old-fashioned low-code wizardry.



## 🚀 What is DinnerTonight?

DinnerTonight is a quirky, smart, and delightfully simple bio generator tailored for dating apps. Just pick your:
- Profession
- Main interest
- Best personality trait

...and BOOM 💥 — your new dating bio is ready to charm some hearts.

## 🛠 Built With

- **Low-code / No-code tools** (because working smarter > working harder)
- **AI text generation magic** (you know the vibes)
- A pinch of CSS sauce for ✨aesthetic✨
- Hosted for free (because love shouldn't cost a thing)

## 💡 Why I Made This

I wanted something quick, witty, and actually useful for people who:
- Struggle writing bios
- Don’t take dating too seriously
- Want to stand out (without sounding like every other “Netflix and pizza” person)

## 📸 Features

- Sleek, dark-mode UI (because we're classy like that)
- Random, clever bio generation
- Zero stress. Just vibes.
- 100% judgment-free zone

2. Select your options from the dropdowns
